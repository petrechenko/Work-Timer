# Work-Timer

A very simple desktop app that helps to set up a timer to remind you about taking breaks and going back to work.
You just need to provide time for work in minutes, time for break an how many circles of work you want to do.

It's thwe version I want to use by myself so I didn't create any design for it as I'm planning to run it in the background.
You can download the executable file from this repository and it will work on Windows only yet.
